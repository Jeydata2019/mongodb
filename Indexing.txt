Indexing:

show dbs

use emp


show collections

db.data.find({user_id:9755})

* we can create an index on the table/collection to retrieve the results faster

if you are selecting the data more often on top of this user id field , create
an index to optimize your execution time:

in mongodb you need to create manaully 

-get the count of this collection/table 

db.data.count()

* let's explore what is going on when you execute this find result command
"db.data.find({user_id:9755})"

db.data.explain().find({user_id:9755})

-stage" : "COLLSCAN", it is scaning the all the fields and finding the record

our case we have only 5000 records, but in prodcution environment we will have 
large number of records: eg. 5 million/billion.it is a expensive call if you
execute a find/search result with out indexing your collection/table

-- creating index for user_id field:

db.data.createIndex({user_id: 1}) 


// one is for assending order -1 dessending order

let's exeucte the same command after creating the index on user_id field 
"db.data.explain().find({user_id:9755})"

db.data.explain().find({user_id:9755})

stage should changed to "FECH" insetead scaning entire collection , it will 
look for newly created index

--aggrecation:
db.data.aggregate([
	{$group: {_id:{occupation: "$occupation"}, avgAge:{$avg: "$age"}}}
	])
